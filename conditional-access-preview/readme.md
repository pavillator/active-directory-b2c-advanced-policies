Updated sample, September 25, 2019, now includes chg_password response end user experience.

Intro
Azure Active Directory provides industry leading advanced detection of identity risks by leveraging threat experiences from billions of authentications across its network.  A rich set of features is provided to mitigate those risks via customer monitoring, manual mitigation and automated mitigation.   These are collectively named Identity Security Protection and Conditional Access (ISP/CA).  The Azure Active Directory team is well on its way to make ISP/CA available for Azure AD B2C workloads.  The AAD Team has a invited a small subset of customers (Preview Customers) to preview the features as they become usable.  This document aims to describe the features, their limitations, and offer a plan to communicate recurrently with the Preview Customers

Confidentiality
Samples, links, and documentation provided during the preview is confidential for use by the Preview Customers and their representatives.  These artifacts will very likely change as we approach public preview and only the Preview Customers will be updated

Note
This sample is insufficient to test the new features. Customer-specific flags must be set to preview.

Preview is private by invitation only.
As always, questions about previews are welcome at AADB2CPREVIEW@microsoft.com
